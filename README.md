# What is this?

I'm exploring WebGL as an intro to OpenGL and graphics programming. This repo contains the projects I do and lets people view them through [this site.](https://hillmarcus.github.io/webgl/)


## Resources

I'll keep a list of the WebGL resources I find while working on this repo.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
  - This is a great resource on a lot of web topics and I've found their WebGL examples and documentation very helpful
- [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) and [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/)
  - I've only used these a little, but they seem like solid references
